# UITAP Automation

A test automation portfolio built on two practice sites. The same 22 UI scenarios from [uitestingplayground.com](http://uitestingplayground.com) are solved twice, with **Python + Playwright** and **Java + Selenium**, and a separate **API suite** tests the REST API of [automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com) with Python + requests. All suites report through Allure and run automatically in CI.

## Why two stacks

Testing the same scenarios in two languages and two frameworks forces an honest comparison: where Playwright's auto-waiting removes boilerplate Selenium needs explicit `WebDriverWait` for, where TestNG's XML suite configuration differs from pytest markers, how BDD (Cucumber vs Behave) changes the shape of a test. It's also just more representative of real teams, where you rarely get to pick one tool forever.

## Tech stack

| | Python | Java |
|---|---|---|
| Browser automation | Playwright | Selenium 4 |
| Test runner | pytest | TestNG |
| BDD | Behave | Cucumber |
| Reporting | Allure | Allure |
| Build/deps | `requirements.txt` (pinned) | Maven |

## API test suite (`python-api/`)

16 tests against the automationexercise.com REST API: products, search, brands, login and a full account lifecycle.

- **API client** (`api_client.py`): one class wraps a `requests.Session` with the base URL and timeout. Tests call methods like `api.search_products("top")` and never build URLs, the same idea as the Page Object Model, one layer down.
- **Fixtures**: one shared client for the whole run; a fresh account per test where tests change data.
- **Test data with cleanup**: every account gets a unique email (`uuid`) and is deleted by a `yield` fixture, even when the test fails.
- **Data-driven and negative tests**: parametrized search terms, missing login fields, unsupported methods, duplicate accounts.

**Finding:** this API reports errors with HTTP `200 OK` and puts the real status (`405`, `400`, `404`) in the JSON body. The tests assert both layers, so they would notice if the API ever started using real status codes.

## CI/CD

Three workflows run on GitHub Actions: `python-playwright.yml`, `java-selenium.yml` and `python-api.yml`.

- **On every push** to any branch, and **nightly at 02:00 UTC** (full regression).
- **Manually** via `workflow_dispatch`, with dropdowns for browser (chromium/firefox/webkit for Python, chrome/firefox for Java) and test group (`smoke` or `regression`).
- The API suite needs no browser and finishes in under a minute, so it runs its **full regression on every push**; the slower UI suites run smoke on push and full regression nightly.
- On `main`, every pipeline publishes its Allure report to GitHub Pages (`/python/`, `/java/`, `/api/`), each with its own trend history. A shared storage branch (`gh-pages-src`) keeps each report in its own subfolder, so no deploy overwrites another.

## Architecture & patterns (Java side)

- **Page Object Model**: `pages/` wraps each page's elements and actions; tests never touch Selenium locators directly.
- **Factory** (`DriverFactory`): one static method builds the right `WebDriver` for the requested browser and headless mode.
- **Singleton** (`DriverManager`): holds exactly one driver instance per test run, exposed via `getDriver()`, torn down via `quitDriver()`.
- **Hooks** (`stepdefinitions/Hooks.java`): Cucumber's `@Before`/`@After` lifecycle wires the Singleton driver into each BDD scenario.

## How to run locally

### Python (Playwright)
```bash
cd python-playwright
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows; use "source .venv/bin/activate" on macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install

pytest -m smoke                 # smoke suite
pytest -m regression            # full regression
behave features/                # BDD scenarios

allure serve allure-results     # view the report locally (needs Node.js + `npm install -g allure-commandline`)
```

### Java (Selenium)
```bash
cd java-selenium
mvn test                                        # full TestNG suite (testng.xml)
mvn test -Dtest=TestRunner                      # Cucumber BDD scenarios
mvn test -Dgroups=smoke -Dbrowser=chrome        # smoke only, explicit browser

allure open allure-report                       # after generating with `allure generate allure-results -o allure-report`
```

### Python (API)
```bash
cd python-api
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

pytest -v                       # all 16 API tests
pytest -m smoke -v              # smoke only
```

## What I learned

A few things from building and maintaining this repo that don't show up in a green checkmark:

- **A flaky test is a symptom, not a verdict.** `ProgressBarTest` failed intermittently for weeks before I isolated the cause: the progress bar's animation speed is randomized per page load (1.4s to 25s observed), and the default 500ms `WebDriverWait` polling interval let fast bars blow straight past the target percentage. Fixed by moving both detection and the stop-click into the browser via `executeAsyncScript` and `requestAnimationFrame`, eliminating the WebDriver round-trip entirely. Verified with 40 consecutive runs at a tightened tolerance before trusting it.
- **"It passed" and "it did what I intended" are different claims.** A code review of an already-green Cucumber run caught a real bug: the `browser` system property was being read but never actually passed to the driver factory, every CI run was silently using the hardcoded default.
- **Headless isn't one thing.** `ShadowDomTest`'s clipboard check was guarded against the wrong kind of "headless", JVM headless (`GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()`) instead of the browser's own headless flag, two genuinely different conditions that happened to usually agree, until they didn't.
- **Not every test works in every browser.** Chromium exposes clipboard permissions Playwright can grant; Firefox doesn't. `test_22_shadowdom.py` now skips cleanly on non-Chromium browsers instead of failing with a confusing permissions error.
- **Status codes can lie.** The practice API answers "method not supported" with HTTP 200. A test that only checks the status code would pass on every error, so the API tests always check the body too.
- **A silenced error is still an error.** A history download ended in `|| true` (on purpose, the first run has no history yet), so when its URL broke, nothing complained: the Python trend graph quietly reset on every run. Now I check the result some other way whenever I hide errors.
